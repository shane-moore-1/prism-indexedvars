April 7, 2020:
    I temporarily commented-out the visit(EISA) in the FindAllVars, since the superclass should be sufficient now.
    The reason I tried this was: when trying to build the btyp file, the listConsider variable did not exist (it was still named queueConsider)
    and when it reached the use of the unknown variable, it was not reporting the usual "Unknown variable" error, but now it is.
    I should possible check other correct models still work.

HOWEVER:
    I restored it back in, because then the TypeCheck visitor complained.
